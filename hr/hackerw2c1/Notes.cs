        [Strings and Indices]
            Strings have indices
            An index is the position of a Char object in the string
            Char objects in strings can have methods applied to them
            Chars[] is a property of strings allowing you to access Chars by their individual index in the string
            
            String class also implements IEnumerable interface ==> iterate through each Char objects using "foreach"

            If this project where using non-English words, you would need to use the EnumerateRunes method & Runes struct.
            This is because unicode characters are not the same as Chars & unicode characters may be encoded as 1+ Char object.

        [Some String methods]
